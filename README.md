# NAVIS 
NAVIS (Nanochannel Velocity and Interfacial Slip) is a research toolkit created with the intention of computing the hydrodynamic and thermal friction that exist at the solid-liquid interface. The toolkit relies on the output from equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD), which is then post-processed to obtain the respective friction coefficients. EMD simulations are performed using [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) package and the post-processing is mainly done using [Python](https://www.python.org/).
